Contributing
============

We are very open to outside contributions, and strive to create an inclusive project.
Feel free to ask questions for clarification as well as to contribute.

Here are some ways you could contribute:

- Join in the [discussion of authoritative sources on StackExchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/59797/authorities-on-password-hashing-best-practice)
- Ask questions about the method, help us clarify, contribute your ideas. You can do so in the Github issues.
- Tell us about updates to the authoritative sources that we have not taken into account in our current evaluations.
- Help us write better tests that cover more edge cases. You can contribute your thoughts as a PR.
- Help us improve documentation by making a PR or issue describing what you think needs clarification.
- Start helping out by answering other people's questions, and help build an atmosphere of constructive debate on how to bring the library forward.

We list all contributors in the README to give credit where it's due---but you can opt out, if you do not want to be listed.

Please remember that all contributors should adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
